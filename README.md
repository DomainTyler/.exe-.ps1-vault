# 🔗 Remote Asset Hosting for PowerShell

This repository exists **solely to host assets** (such as scripts, config files, or other resources) that are intended to be launched or accessed remotely from PowerShell using direct URLs.

## ⚙️ Purpose

The goal is to allow seamless execution of resources from PowerShell without requiring users to manually download or store files locally. By referencing the raw file URLs in your PowerShell commands (e.g., via `Invoke-WebRequest`, `iwr`, or `Invoke-Expression`), you can run or use these assets on-demand.

Example:
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YourUsername/YourRepo/main/some-script.ps1 | iex
```
